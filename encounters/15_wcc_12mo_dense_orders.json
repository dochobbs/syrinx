    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Happy birthday to Oliver! One year already!", "direction": "celebratory"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "I know, it went so fast. He's a totally different person than a year ago.", "direction": "reflective"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let's see what he's up to. Is he walking yet?", "direction": "developmental"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Cruising along furniture, taking a few steps between things, but not walking independently yet.", "direction": "describing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's perfect for twelve months. Any words?", "direction": "language"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Dada, mama, ball, dog. Maybe five or six words.", "direction": "counting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Excellent. Does he follow simple instructions like 'give me the ball' or 'wave bye-bye'?", "direction": "receptive language"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Yeah, he understands a lot. He points at things he wants.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Great. How's eating going? Still on formula or have you switched to milk?", "direction": "nutrition"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "We just switched to whole milk this week. He's taking it fine. Eating table food pretty well too.", "direction": "updating"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Perfect timing on the milk switch. Is he using a cup at all?", "direction": "feeding skills"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Sippy cup mostly. We're trying an open cup but it's messy.", "direction": "describing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's normal. Keep practicing with the open cup. By eighteen months we want to be off bottles completely.", "direction": "guidance"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Got it. No bottles by eighteen months.", "direction": "noting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me examine him.", "direction": "transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "He's twenty-two pounds and thirty inches. That's 60th percentile for weight and 55th for height. Head circumference is 75th percentile, same as before. All consistent.", "direction": "measurements"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Ears are clear, heart and lungs normal. Teeth look good, I see eight teeth. Belly is soft. Walking along the table nicely.", "direction": "exam"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "He looks wonderful. Now, one year visits are big ones. We have several things to do today.", "direction": "transitioning to orders"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Lay it on me.", "direction": "ready"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "First, labs. We need to check his hemoglobin, that's a blood count to screen for anemia. And we check lead level at one year. It's a finger poke.", "direction": "lab orders"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Both from the finger poke?", "direction": "clarifying"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes, one poke gets us both tests.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Okay. What about vaccines?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "He needs four vaccines today. MMR, which is measles, mumps, rubella. Varicella, that's chickenpox. Hepatitis A, first dose. And Prevnar, which is pneumococcal.", "direction": "vaccine list"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Four vaccines. He's going to be mad at me.", "direction": "anticipating"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "He'll forgive you. We'll do two in each leg. It's quick.", "direction": "practical"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Any side effects I should watch for?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Fussiness and low-grade fever are common. The MMR and varicella can sometimes cause a mild rash or fever about a week later. That's actually a sign the vaccine is working.", "direction": "anticipatory guidance"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Good to know. What else?", "direction": "continuing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me go through some safety and development guidance. At this age, drowning is a big risk. Never leave him alone near water, even an inch of it.", "direction": "safety"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "We have a pool at my parents' house. We're careful.", "direction": "acknowledging"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Good. Always within arm's reach in water. Also, car seat should be rear-facing until age two, or until he maxes out the height and weight limits.", "direction": "car safety"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He's still rear-facing.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Perfect. Outlet covers, cabinet locks, gates on stairs?", "direction": "home safety"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "All done. House is baby-proofed.", "direction": "prepared"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Great. Screen time, try to avoid it before age two if possible. Reading and interactive play are much better for brain development.", "direction": "media guidance"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "We read to him every night.", "direction": "good habit"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Love to hear it. Last thing, start brushing his teeth twice a day with a tiny smear of fluoride toothpaste, rice grain size.", "direction": "dental"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "We've been using the training toothpaste without fluoride.", "direction": "current practice"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Time to switch to fluoride now that he has teeth. It prevents cavities.", "direction": "updating guidance"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Got it. So, to recap: finger poke for anemia and lead, four vaccines, rear-facing until two, fluoride toothpaste. Anything else?", "direction": "summarizing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That covers it. Next visit is fifteen months. Call if any concerns before then.", "direction": "follow up"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thanks, Doc. Here we go, buddy.", "direction": "to child, bracing"}
