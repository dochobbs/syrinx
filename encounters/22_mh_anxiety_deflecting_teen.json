    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hey Chloe. Your mom scheduled this visit because she's worried about you. What's going on?", "direction": "opening"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Nothing. I'm fine. She worries too much.", "direction": "dismissive"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "She's not fine. She's been in her room constantly. She barely eats. Something's wrong.", "direction": "concerned"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Mom, can you not?", "direction": "annoyed"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me talk to Chloe for a bit. Mom, want to wait outside and I'll call you back in?", "direction": "separating"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Fine. But please talk to her.", "direction": "leaving"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay, just us. What's actually going on in your life?", "direction": "direct but casual"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Ugh, nothing. I'm just tired of her asking me what's wrong all the time.", "direction": "frustrated"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That sounds annoying. What have you been up to lately?", "direction": "different angle"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Just school. And my phone. Did you see that TikTok about the girl who got locked in a bathroom at school?", "direction": "deflecting to pop culture"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I haven't. Is TikTok a big thing for you?", "direction": "going with it"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I mean yeah, everyone's on it. I spend like hours on it.", "direction": "engaging"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "What kind of stuff do you watch?", "direction": "building rapport"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Funny stuff. Drama. There's this whole thing with my friend group right now that's like straight out of a TikTok.", "direction": "friend drama"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Oh yeah? What's happening?", "direction": "listening"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "So my friend Maddie told Emma that I said something about her but I literally didn't, and now Emma won't talk to me and they're both being weird.", "direction": "venting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That sounds stressful.", "direction": "validating"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "It's so dumb. I don't even care.", "direction": "dismissing but clearly cares"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "How does it make you feel when you think about seeing them at school?", "direction": "connecting to feelings"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I don't know. Anxious I guess.", "direction": "admitting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Tell me about that anxiety. What does it feel like?", "direction": "probing"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Just... nervous. Like my stomach hurts.", "direction": "vague"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Has it ever gotten really bad? Like beyond just nervous?", "direction": "digging"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I mean... there was this one time.", "direction": "hesitating"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Tell me about it.", "direction": "encouraging"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "It was at school. I was in the cafeteria and suddenly I couldn't breathe. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I was dying. I had to go to the nurse.", "direction": "revealing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That sounds terrifying. How long did it last?", "direction": "characterizing"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Maybe like ten minutes? It felt like forever. The nurse said it was a panic attack.", "direction": "identifying"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Has it happened again since then?", "direction": "frequency"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Yeah. Like three more times. Once at home, twice at school.", "direction": "recurrent"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Do you know what triggered them?", "direction": "triggers"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "The one at home was when my parents were fighting about money. At school, I don't know. Maybe just being around people.", "direction": "exploring"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "So you're having panic attacks. Why didn't you tell your mom?", "direction": "understanding barrier"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I don't want her to freak out. She already treats me like I'm broken.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "You're not broken. Panic attacks are really common, especially in teenagers. They're treatable.", "direction": "normalizing"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Really?", "direction": "surprised"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yeah. They're your body's alarm system going off when there's no real danger. We can teach you how to manage them.", "direction": "psychoeducation"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I don't want to take pills.", "direction": "preempting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's not the first step anyway. The first step is learning techniques to calm your body down when it happens. Breathing exercises, grounding techniques. A therapist can teach you.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Therapy sounds weird.", "direction": "resistant"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It's just talking to someone who specializes in this stuff. Like talking to me, but they have more time and more tools.", "direction": "reframing"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I guess I can try it.", "direction": "agreeing tentatively"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Good. I'm going to teach you one thing right now. When you feel a panic attack starting, try breathing in for four counts, holding for four, and out for four. Can you practice with me?", "direction": "intervention"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Okay. In, two, three, four. Hold, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four.", "direction": "practicing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Perfect. Do that as soon as you feel the symptoms starting. It won't make it disappear but it can make it shorter.", "direction": "empowering"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Thanks. Do you have to tell my mom everything?", "direction": "privacy concern"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I'm going to tell her you're having anxiety and panic attacks and we have a plan. I won't tell her the details of our conversation. But she needs to know enough to support you.", "direction": "honest"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Okay. That's fair.", "direction": "accepting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let's bring her back in.", "direction": "transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "What did you find out?", "direction": "returning, anxious"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Chloe's been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. She was brave enough to open up about it. We're going to get her into therapy and she's going to be okay.", "direction": "summary"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Panic attacks? Oh honey, why didn't you tell me?", "direction": "emotional"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I didn't want you to worry.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "The good news is we can help. I'll send over a referral to a therapist, and let's follow up in four weeks.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Chloe, for talking.", "direction": "grateful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Chloe, remember, four-four-four breathing. And text your mom when you're feeling anxious instead of hiding in your room. Deal?", "direction": "practical advice"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Deal.", "direction": "agreeing"}
