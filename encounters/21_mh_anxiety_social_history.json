    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. How often does that happen?", "direction": "frequency"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Almost every day. Especially before school.", "direction": "frequent"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "What do you think triggers it?", "direction": "exploring"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I don't know. Just... everything. Tests, talking to people, what if I do something wrong.", "direction": "generalized worry"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "She's missed a lot of school because of it. Some days she just can't go.", "direction": "impact"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "What does the custody arrangement look like?", "direction": "probing"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "We do week on, week off. She goes back and forth between houses.", "direction": "custody"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "It's confusing. I never know where my stuff is.", "direction": "teen perspective"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That does sound hard. Any conflict between your parents?", "direction": "parental conflict"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Ava, I'm going to ask you to fill out a couple of questionnaires about how you've been feeling. Is that okay?", "direction": "screening"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Sure.", "direction": "agreeing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay, I have her GAD-7 and PHQ-9 here.", "direction": "reviewing completed forms"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Ava, your GAD-7 score is 14, which indicates moderate anxiety. Your PHQ-9 is 8, which is mild depression.", "direction": "results"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Depression too?", "direction": "concerned"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Anxiety and depression often go together. The good news is both are treatable.", "direction": "normalizing"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay, thank you for being honest. Here's what I recommend.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "First, therapy. I think cognitive behavioral therapy specifically would help a lot. It teaches you skills to manage anxious thoughts. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Singh.", "direction": "therapy referral"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I've never done therapy before.", "direction": "hesitant"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's okay. It's just talking to someone who can teach you new ways to cope. Most kids find it really helpful.", "direction": "encouraging"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Does she need medication?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I'd like to try therapy first. If she's still really struggling after six to eight weeks, we can add an SSRI. But let's give therapy a chance.", "direction": "stepwise"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "That makes sense.", "direction": "agreeing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Also, I want to check in with you in three to four weeks to see how she's doing. And Ava, some basic things can help: regular sleep, limiting caffeine, exercise, time off screens.", "direction": "lifestyle"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "Okay.", "direction": "accepting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "You've been through a lot of changes in the past two years. It makes sense that you're feeling anxious. But you don't have to feel this way forever.", "direction": "validating"},
    {"speaker": "teen", "text": "I hope so.", "direction": "hopeful"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thank you for taking this seriously.", "direction": "grateful"},
