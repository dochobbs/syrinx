    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay. She's reading about 20/50 in both eyes. That's enough to cause eye strain headaches, especially with close work and screen time.", "direction": "findings"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "So she needs glasses?", "direction": "concluding"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Very likely. I'm going to refer her to an optometrist, Dr. Williams, for a full eye exam and glasses prescription. I think once we correct her vision, the headaches will improve significantly.", "direction": "plan"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me do a quick neuro exam to be safe.", "direction": "examination"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Follow my finger with your eyes. Good. Squeeze my hands. Push against me. Smile, raise your eyebrows. Everything looks normal neurologically.", "direction": "examining"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "That's a relief.", "direction": "relieved"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "In the meantime, while you wait for the eye appointment, she can take ibuprofen for the headaches. Also make sure she takes breaks from screens every 20 minutes.", "direction": "interim management"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "How long should we wait to see if the glasses help?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let's have her come back in four weeks. If she's still having headaches after she has glasses, we'll dig deeper. But I'm optimistic this is vision-related.", "direction": "follow up plan"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Sounds good. So the plan is eye doctor referral, ibuprofen as needed, and follow up in four weeks?", "direction": "summarizing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Exactly right. I'll put in the referral to Dr. Williams and schedule your follow up before you leave.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Do I get to pick my glasses?", "direction": "hopeful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "You sure do. That's the fun part.", "direction": "to child, friendly"},
