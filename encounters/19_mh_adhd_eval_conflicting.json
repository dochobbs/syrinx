    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hi everyone. I understand you're here because of some concerns about Caleb's attention and behavior?", "direction": "opening"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Yes, his teacher has been worried. She sent home the Vanderbilt form you gave us.", "direction": "handing forms"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I think the teacher is overreacting. He's a normal boy. Boys are hyper.", "direction": "dismissive"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Mike, the teacher has been doing this for twenty years. I don't think she's overreacting.", "direction": "disagreeing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me look at the forms and then hear from both of you. I want to understand what Caleb is like in different settings.", "direction": "mediating"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "So the teacher's Vanderbilt shows scores in the significant range for inattention and hyperactivity. She notes he can't stay seated, blurts out answers, and has trouble finishing assignments.", "direction": "reviewing"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "That's every kid. You expect a seven-year-old to sit still for six hours?", "direction": "challenging"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "You make a fair point. That's why we compare to other kids his age. The Vanderbilt has norms for that. His scores are higher than 95% of his peers.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "She also said he's behind in reading because he can't focus during instruction.", "direction": "adding"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "Reading just takes longer for some kids.", "direction": "alternative explanation"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "What's Caleb like at home? Let's start with you, Mom.", "direction": "gathering parent input"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "It's hard. Homework takes forever because he can't sit still. He starts one thing, gets distracted, forgets what he was doing. He loses stuff constantly.", "direction": "describing"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "He does fine when he's playing video games. He focuses on that for hours.", "direction": "counterargument"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's actually consistent with ADHD. Kids with ADHD can hyperfocus on things they find highly stimulating, like video games. It's the boring, effortful tasks they struggle with.", "direction": "educating"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "That makes sense. He can't focus on homework but can play Minecraft forever.", "direction": "connecting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Dad, what's your experience with Caleb? When you're together, what's he like?", "direction": "to dad"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "He's fine. We play catch, ride bikes, go to his games. He's a great kid.", "direction": "positive"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Those are all physical, active things. What about quieter activities? Does he sit through dinner? Through a movie?", "direction": "probing"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "Well, he's up and down at dinner. Movies are hard unless it's something he really likes.", "direction": "admitting"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Can I play on your phone, Mom?", "direction": "interrupting"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Not right now, sweetie. We're talking to the doctor.", "direction": "redirecting"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "But I'm bored. This is boring.", "direction": "restless"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hey Caleb, I have some paper and crayons in that drawer. Want to draw while we talk?", "direction": "managing child"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Okay.", "direction": "accepting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me review the parent Vanderbilts. Mom, your form shows elevated scores for inattention and hyperactivity too. Dad, your scores are lower, but still showing some inattention symptoms.", "direction": "comparing forms"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I marked them lower because I don't think it's that bad.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It's actually common for parents to see things differently, especially when one parent does more of the homework and school stuff.", "direction": "normalizing"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "That's mostly me.", "direction": "acknowledging"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "So you see more of the struggle. Dad sees more of Caleb at his best, during fun activities.", "direction": "bridging"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I'm not saying there's no issue. I just don't want him labeled and drugged up.", "direction": "revealing concern"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a really important concern, and I'm glad you said it. A diagnosis isn't a label, it's a roadmap. It helps us understand how his brain works and what supports he needs.", "direction": "reframing"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "But medication changes kids. I've heard stories.", "direction": "worry"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Medication is one option, not the only option. And we wouldn't jump to that first anyway. There are behavioral strategies, school accommodations, and other approaches.", "direction": "reassuring"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "So do you think he has ADHD?", "direction": "asking for conclusion"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Based on the Vanderbilt scores from both teachers and parents, and what I'm observing today, and the history you've shared, yes, I think Caleb meets criteria for ADHD, combined type, meaning both inattention and hyperactivity.", "direction": "diagnosis"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "What does that actually mean for him?", "direction": "wanting to understand"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It means his brain's executive function, the part that helps with planning, focus, and impulse control, works differently. It's not a character flaw. It's neurobiology.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Here's what I recommend. First, we request a 504 plan at school for accommodations, like extra time on tests and preferential seating. Second, I'd like you to try some behavioral strategies at home. I'll give you a handout.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "What about medication?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let's try these things first and see how he does. If he's still really struggling in six to eight weeks, we can discuss whether medication would help. It's a tool, not a requirement.", "direction": "stepwise approach"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "That seems reasonable. I can live with that.", "direction": "agreeing"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Me too. Thank you for hearing us both out.", "direction": "grateful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's my job. Let's schedule a follow-up in about eight weeks. And call sooner if anything changes.", "direction": "follow up"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Look, I drew a robot!", "direction": "showing drawing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a cool robot, Caleb. Good job.", "direction": "to child, warm"}
