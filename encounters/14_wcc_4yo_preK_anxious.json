    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hi Zoe, hi Mom! Big day, getting ready for pre-K!", "direction": "enthusiastic"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "I'm gonna go to big kid school!", "direction": "excited"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "She's so excited. We're here for her school physical. She needs the form filled out.", "direction": "practical"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Absolutely. Let me see how she's doing first. Any concerns since her last visit?", "direction": "opening"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "No, she's healthy. I'm just nervous about the shots. How many does she need today?", "direction": "anxious"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "At four years, she'll need DTaP, polio, and MMR. So three injections.", "direction": "answering"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Three? That seems like a lot. Is that safe?", "direction": "worried"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It's very safe. These are boosters of vaccines she's already had, so her immune system recognizes them. It just boosts her protection.", "direction": "reassuring"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Do I have to get shots?", "direction": "worried"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes, sweetie, but they're quick. You're a brave girl.", "direction": "to child"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "She had a fever after her last shots. Will that happen again?", "direction": "recalling"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It might. A low fever for a day or two is normal. You can give Tylenol if she's uncomfortable.", "direction": "anticipating"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "What about that MMR vaccine? I've heard things about that one.", "direction": "specific concern"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "The MMR is very safe. The study that claimed it caused autism was fraudulent and has been completely discredited. Millions of kids get MMR safely every year.", "direction": "direct, evidence-based"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Are you sure it's okay to give all three at once?", "direction": "re-asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes, I'm sure. This is the standard schedule used nationwide. It's the safest and most effective approach.", "direction": "firm, reassuring"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Now let me check her vision and hearing.", "direction": "transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Zoe, can you point to the pictures I point to? Good. Now cover this eye.", "direction": "testing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hmm. She's having trouble with the smaller pictures on the left eye. Let me try again.", "direction": "examining"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Is something wrong?", "direction": "concerned"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Her right eye reads 20/30 which is okay for her age, but the left is only 20/50. I'd like her to see an eye doctor for a full exam.", "direction": "finding"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Does she need glasses?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Possibly. The optometrist will do a more thorough evaluation. I'll put in a referral today.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Okay. What about her hearing?", "direction": "continuing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me check that now. Zoe, raise your hand when you hear the beep.", "direction": "testing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "She's passing on the right. And the left. Hearing is fine.", "direction": "results"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Good. Back to the vaccines, you're really sure they're safe together?", "direction": "asking again"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes. I promise you, I give these same vaccines to hundreds of kids. They're safe.", "direction": "patient repetition"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me do her physical exam.", "direction": "moving on"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Heart and lungs sound great. Belly is soft. She looks healthy.", "direction": "examining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Height and weight are both around 60th percentile. Growing well.", "direction": "growth"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Can I get a copy of the school form?", "direction": "practical"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I'll complete it and the front desk will give you a copy. Any restrictions on activities?", "direction": "form question"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "No, she can do everything.", "direction": "answering"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Great. So to summarize: she's getting three vaccines today, I'm referring her to the optometrist for the left eye, and I'll complete the school form.", "direction": "summary"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "And if she gets a fever tonight, Tylenol?", "direction": "confirming again"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes, Tylenol or Motrin is fine.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thank you. Sorry for asking so many questions.", "direction": "self-aware"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Never apologize for that. It's your job to ask questions. The nurse will be in with the vaccines.", "direction": "closing graciously"}
