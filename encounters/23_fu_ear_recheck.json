    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "So it didn't work?", "direction": "asking"},

    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "What's the stronger one?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I'm going to prescribe Augmentin. It's amoxicillin plus another ingredient that helps it work against resistant bacteria.", "direction": "new medication"},

    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Does she finish the old one first?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "No, stop the amoxicillin and start the Augmentin right away.", "direction": "clarifying"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Will this one definitely work?", "direction": "seeking reassurance"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Augmentin works on most resistant ear infections. If she's not better in three to four days, call me. But I expect this will do the trick.", "direction": "realistic"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Should I bring her back again to recheck?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Only if she's still having symptoms after finishing the Augmentin. If she improves and stays well, no need.", "direction": "conditional follow up"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Okay. I'll start it tonight.", "direction": "agreeing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Good. Give it with food, it's easier on the stomach. And keep up with Tylenol or Motrin for the pain.", "direction": "advice"},
