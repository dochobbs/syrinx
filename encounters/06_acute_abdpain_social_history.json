    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hi Aiden, hi Mom. I see Aiden's having stomach pain?", "direction": "greeting"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Yes, it's been going on for about two weeks now. Some days are worse than others. He's missed three days of school already.", "direction": "concerned, detailed"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Two weeks is a while. Aiden, can you point to where it hurts?", "direction": "engaging child"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Here, around my belly button. Sometimes all over.", "direction": "pointing, vague"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Is it there all the time or does it come and go?", "direction": "characterizing"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "It comes and goes. Sometimes really bad, then it's okay.", "direction": "describing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "What makes it worse? Eating? Certain foods?", "direction": "triggers"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He says it's worse in the morning before school. And he's been eating less. He used to love breakfast but now he barely touches it.", "direction": "observational"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Any vomiting or diarrhea?", "direction": "associated symptoms"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "No.", "direction": "brief"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Constipation? When was your last poop and was it normal?", "direction": "bowel habits"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Um, yesterday. It was normal I guess.", "direction": "embarrassed"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Good. Any blood in your stool or black stools?", "direction": "red flags"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "No, nothing like that.", "direction": "answering"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Has he lost any weight?", "direction": "concerning sign"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "I don't think so. Maybe a pound or two? It's hard to tell.", "direction": "uncertain"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I want to ask about family history. Any digestive problems in the family?", "direction": "transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Actually yes. His dad has Crohn's disease. He was diagnosed in his twenties. And my sister has celiac disease.", "direction": "significant history"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's helpful to know. Anyone else with GI issues? Ulcers, colitis?", "direction": "probing further"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "His grandfather, my dad, had colon cancer. But he was in his seventies.", "direction": "more history"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay. I appreciate you sharing all that. Let me ask about what's going on at home and school. Any big changes recently?", "direction": "social history"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Well... his dad and I are getting divorced. We told the kids about a month ago. And he just started at a new school this year because we moved.", "direction": "revealing, hesitant"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a lot of change. How's the new school going, Aiden?", "direction": "to child, gentle"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "It's okay. I don't really know anyone yet.", "direction": "subdued"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He's had trouble making friends. His old school was small and he knew everyone. This one is much bigger.", "direction": "expanding"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That can be really hard. Do you like your teachers?", "direction": "continuing with child"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "They're fine. I just... I don't like going.", "direction": "admitting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Does your stomach hurt more on school days or weekends?", "direction": "key question"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Now that you mention it, he does seem better on weekends. I thought it was because he's resting more.", "direction": "realizing pattern"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me examine his belly.", "direction": "transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Aiden, lie back for me. I'm going to press on your tummy. Tell me if anything hurts.", "direction": "examining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "His abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. No guarding or rebound. That's reassuring.", "direction": "findings"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Here's what I'm thinking. Given the family history of Crohn's and celiac, I do want to run some blood tests to screen for those. We'll check a CBC, inflammatory markers, and celiac antibodies.", "direction": "plan"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Okay. What if those come back normal?", "direction": "anticipating"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "If the labs are normal and his exam is normal, which it is today, then we're likely dealing with functional abdominal pain. That's real pain, but it's related to stress and how the gut and brain communicate.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "So you think the divorce and new school could be causing this?", "direction": "connecting dots"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "It's very possible. The gut is incredibly sensitive to stress, especially in kids. That doesn't mean the pain isn't real, it absolutely is. But the treatment might involve more than just medication.", "direction": "validating, educating"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Like what?", "direction": "asking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Depending on the labs, we might consider a referral to a therapist who works with kids going through transitions. Sometimes addressing the anxiety helps the stomach.", "direction": "psychosocial support"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He's already seeing the school counselor once a week.", "direction": "informing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a great start. Let's get these labs and go from there. If the celiac screen or inflammatory markers are elevated, we'll refer to GI. Otherwise, we'll focus on stress management and see if things improve.", "direction": "contingency plan"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thank you for taking this seriously. I was worried you'd just say it's in his head.", "direction": "grateful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Never. His pain is real. We just need to figure out what's driving it. Aiden, we're going to help you feel better, okay?", "direction": "reassuring both"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Okay.", "direction": "quiet"}
