    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Chen. Sophie's here for ear pain?", "direction": "greeting"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Yes, she's been complaining about her ear since yesterday morning. She was up all night crying.", "direction": "worried, emphatic"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "Well, it wasn't all night. She woke up once around two AM.", "direction": "correcting, matter of fact"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "She was up multiple times, Mike. You just slept through it.", "direction": "frustrated, contradicting"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay, so it sounds like it started yesterday. Sophie, can you point to where it hurts?", "direction": "redirecting to child"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Here. This ear.", "direction": "pointing, upset"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "The right ear. Has she had a fever?", "direction": "systematic"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Yes, 101 last night. I gave her Tylenol.", "direction": "reporting"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I checked this morning and she was 99. That's not really a fever.", "direction": "minimizing"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Because the Tylenol brought it down. It was definitely 101 last night.", "direction": "insistent"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Got it, so she did have a fever that responded to Tylenol. Any other symptoms? Runny nose, cough?", "direction": "moving forward"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "She's had a cold for like a week. I think this is just part of the cold.", "direction": "offering theory"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "She's had a runny nose but the ear pain is new. That's not just a cold.", "direction": "disagreeing"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "My ear hurts really bad!", "direction": "whining, emphasizing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I hear you, sweetie. Let me take a look and see what's going on.", "direction": "soothing, transitioning"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay Sophie, I'm going to look in your ears with this light. Hold still for me.", "direction": "examining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Left ear looks clear. Now the right side... yeah, I can see the eardrum is red and bulging. There's fluid behind it. She does have an ear infection.", "direction": "findings"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "See? I knew it. She needs antibiotics.", "direction": "validated, pushing"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I read that most ear infections clear up on their own. Can't we just wait and see?", "direction": "questioning, alternative view"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's actually a fair point. For kids over two with mild symptoms, watchful waiting is an option. But Sophie is four and she has a fever and significant pain, which makes me lean toward treating.", "direction": "balanced, clinical reasoning"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "She's miserable. I don't want to wait and have her suffer.", "direction": "advocating"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "I just don't want to give antibiotics if she doesn't need them. What about resistance and all that?", "direction": "concerned, informed"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I appreciate you thinking about that. Antibiotic stewardship is important. But in this case, with the bulging eardrum and her symptoms, I do think antibiotics are appropriate. We'll use a narrow-spectrum one.", "direction": "validating, recommending"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "What if we wait 24 hours and see if she improves?", "direction": "negotiating"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Mike, she's in pain. Why would we wait?", "direction": "exasperated"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Here's what I'd suggest as a middle ground. I can write the prescription today. You could fill it and start tonight, or you could wait until tomorrow morning and see how she's doing. If she's significantly better, you could hold off. If she's the same or worse, start the antibiotic.", "direction": "compromise"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "That seems reasonable.", "direction": "agreeing"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "I'm going to fill it and start it tonight. She needs it.", "direction": "decided"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's completely fine too. Either approach works. I'll send over amoxicillin, twice a day for ten days. Keep up with the Tylenol or Motrin for pain.", "direction": "prescribing"},
    {"speaker": "child", "text": "Is it the pink medicine? I like the pink one.", "direction": "perking up"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Yes, it's the pink one. You'll take it twice a day, morning and bedtime.", "direction": "to child, friendly"},
    {"speaker": "mom", "text": "Thank you, Doctor. Should we follow up?", "direction": "practical"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "If she's not better in three days, or if she gets worse, call us. Otherwise, you don't need a recheck unless the symptoms come back.", "direction": "return precautions"},
    {"speaker": "dad", "text": "Thanks. Sorry we were, uh, not on the same page.", "direction": "slightly embarrassed"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "No apology needed. It's good that you both advocate for her. Feel better, Sophie.", "direction": "gracious, closing"}
