    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Hi, good to see you and Jayden! He's gotten so big.", "direction": "warm greeting"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "I know, he's growing like crazy. He's into everything now.", "direction": "proud"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's what nine month olds do! Tell me what new things he's doing.", "direction": "developmental assessment"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He's crawling everywhere, pulling up on furniture, babbling a lot. He says mama and dada. He waves bye-bye.", "direction": "reporting milestones"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's all great. Is he picking up small things with his fingers?", "direction": "fine motor"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Oh yeah, he picks up every little crumb off the floor. I can't keep up.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Perfect. How about eating? Is he taking solid foods well?", "direction": "nutrition"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "He eats pretty much everything we give him. Purees and some soft table food now. Still breastfeeding a few times a day too.", "direction": "describing"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Wonderful. I want to update my information about your home situation. Who's living in the home with Jayden?", "direction": "social history"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Okay, so three generations. Is Jayden's father involved?", "direction": "probing"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Not really. He sees him sometimes but it's not consistent. We're not together anymore.", "direction": "honest"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "I understand. Who watches Jayden when you're at work?", "direction": "childcare"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "My grandma mostly. She's retired so she's home during the day. My mom helps when she can but she works too.", "direction": "explaining"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "And what do you do for work?", "direction": "continuing"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "I work at Target. I do the night shift, four to midnight, so I can be with him during the day. It's exhausting but it works.", "direction": "hardworking"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a lot to manage. How are you holding up?", "direction": "checking on mom"},

    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Why the change?", "direction": "exploring"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "My grandma's been having some health issues. Her arthritis is getting worse. I don't want to rely on her too much. And I think daycare might be good for him, you know, other kids to play with.", "direction": "practical, thoughtful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "That's a really mature decision. When would that start?", "direction": "affirming"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Maybe next month? I'm still figuring out the details.", "direction": "planning"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Let me know if you need any paperwork for enrollment. Sometimes they need a physical form.", "direction": "offering help"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Oh, that would be helpful. I didn't think about that.", "direction": "grateful"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Now let me examine Jayden.", "direction": "transitioning"},

    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "The finger poke, is that the one where they check his iron?", "direction": "clarifying"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "Exactly. We check all babies at nine months. It's quick.", "direction": "confirming"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Okay. When do I bring him back?", "direction": "follow up"},
    {"speaker": "doctor", "text": "At twelve months for his one year check. Lots of vaccines at that visit too, so prepare yourself.", "direction": "anticipating"},
    {"speaker": "parent", "text": "Thanks for always checking on us both. It means a lot.", "direction": "appreciative"},
